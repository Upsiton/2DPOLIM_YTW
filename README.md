The codes for my master's project "2D Polarization Fluorescence Imaging (2DPOLIM)". Aiming for calculation in the polarization measurement. 

The sample data (csv files) for running the "Get_Pol_Angle.py" is stored in the folder "Samples". "PM_20210114_4_Laser_LC_0mA_0V_Background_25s.csv" is the recorded background of the measurement. Others are data from polarization measurement. Put in the full file name (with .csv) during running the script.
